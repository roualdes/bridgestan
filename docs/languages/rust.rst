Rust Interface
==============

`See the BridgeStan Crate documentation on docs.rs <https://docs.rs/bridgestan>`__

----

Installation
------------

The BridgeStan Rust client is available on `crates.io <https://crates.io/crates/bridgestan>`__ and via :command:`cargo`:

.. code-block:: shell

    cargo add bridgestan

A copy of the BridgeStan C++ sources is needed to compile models. This can be downloaded to
:file:`~/.bridgestan/` automatically if you use the ``download-bridgestan-src`` feature.
Otherwise, it can be downloaded manually (see :doc:`../getting-started`).

Note that the system pre-requisites from the :doc:`Getting Started guide <../getting-started>`
are still required and will not be automatically installed by this method.

Example Program
---------------

An example program is provided alongside the Rust crate in :file:`examples/example.rs`:

.. raw:: html

   <details>
   <summary><a>Show example.rs</a></summary>


.. literalinclude:: ../../rust/examples/example.rs
   :language: Rust

.. raw:: html

   </details>
