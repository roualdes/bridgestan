Python Interface
================

----

Installation
------------

From PyPI
_________

For convenience, BridgeStan is uploaded to the Python Package Index each release.

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install bridgestan


The first time you compile a model, the BridgeStan source code for your current version
will be downloaded and placed in :file:`~/.bridgestan/`.
If you prefer to use a source distribution of BridgeStan, consult the following section.

Note that the system pre-requisites from the :doc:`Getting Started guide <../getting-started>` 
are still required and will not be automatically installed by this method.

From Source
___________
This assumes you have followed the :doc:`Getting Started guide <../getting-started>` to install
BridgeStan's pre-requisites and downloaded a copy of the BridgeStan source code.

To install the Python interface, you can either install it directly from Github with

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install "git+https://github.com/roualdes/bridgestan.git#egg=bridgestan&subdirectory=python"

Or, since you have already downloaded the repository, you can run

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install -e python/

from the BridgeStan folder.

To use the BridgeStan source you've manually downloaded instead of
one the package will download for you, you must use :func:`set_bridgestan_path`
or the ``$BRIDGESTAN`` environment variable.


Note that the Python package depends on Python 3.9+ and NumPy, and will install
NumPy if it is not already installed.
