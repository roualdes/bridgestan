# BridgeStan Documentation

This folder hosts the top-level documentation for BridgeStan.

These docs are available online at
[https://roualdes.github.io/bridgestan/](https://roualdes.github.io/bridgestan/).

## Building

Building the documentation is documented [here](https://roualdes.github.io/bridgestan/internals/documentation.html).

The main documentation can be build by running `make docs` in the top-level
repository. `make` can also be run in this folder to produce a specific format,
for example `make latexpdf` will produce a PDF manual of the documentation, assuming
a LaTeX toolchain is available.
