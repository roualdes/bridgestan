Welcome to BridgeStan's documentation!
======================================

BridgeStan provides efficient in-memory access through Python, Julia,
and R to the methods of a `Stan <https://mc-stan.org>`__ model, including
log densities, gradients, Hessians, and constraining and unconstraining
transforms.

The motivation is developing inference algorithms in
higher-level languages for arbitrary Stan models, such as those in
`posteriordb <https://github.com/stan-dev/posteriordb>`__.
